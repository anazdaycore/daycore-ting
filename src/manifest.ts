// 汀's self-introduction: who it is, and what it can theme.
//
// This is the thing POST /api/version wants. See docs/specs/frontend-manifest.md
// — the backend adjudicates and answers with which family it assigned us, which
// tokens were new, and which of our proposed kinds are still waiting on a human.

// ⚠️ The SHAPES come from @daycore/core; the CONTENT below is 汀's own. Its
// token space and family id are its identity — four products do not share those,
// and a shared constant would make adding a frontend an edit to everybody.
import { SPEAKS } from '@daycore/core';
import type { KindSpec, Manifest, TokenSpec } from '@daycore/core';

// ⚠️ FAMILY_ID is the theme-compatibility group, not the build.
//
// Every 汀 build — web, a Capacitor shell, whatever comes later — declares
// "ting", so a theme somebody made on their phone is the same theme on their
// desktop. The operator can move a build to another family from the console,
// and that assignment WINS over this constant; the handshake response's
// assignedFamilyId is the answer, not this.
export const FAMILY_ID = 'ting';

export const DISPLAY_NAME = '汀 · 此刻';

// MIN_API is the oldest backend this build knows how to talk to.
//
// Bumped when 汀 starts *requiring* something new — not when it starts using
// something new behind a capability check. The difference matters: the first
// locks out deployments, the second degrades on them.
// ⚠️ 从 core 取，不再各写一份。四份 `= 1` 曾经同时是错的：core 的 paths.ts
// 硬写 /api/v2，所以对着 v1 后端每个请求都 404，而这个数字说「能连」。
// 一个前端如果真的需要比 core 更新的契约，那时候再在这里覆盖它。

/**
 * The shadow kind.
 *
 * ⚠️ This is the third tier, and 汀 needs it on day one — which is a decent
 * sign the tier was worth building. `--shadow` is `0 24px 70px rgba(0,0,0,.55)`,
 * and none of the six embedded kinds can express it: `list-of<length>` rejects
 * the colour in the fourth position, and a colour kind rejects the offsets.
 *
 * Until an operator approves it, the backend holds `--shadow` out of the family
 * and says so in `deferredTokens`. 汀 keeps working — its own stylesheet default
 * applies, and the only thing missing is the ability to theme that one value.
 * That degradation is the whole design: propose, keep working, wait for a human.
 *
 * The pattern is deliberately tight. Three lengths and one colour function, in
 * that order, and nothing else — an inset shadow or a spread list would be a
 * different kind rather than a looser version of this one, because a pattern an
 * operator cannot read at a glance is a pattern they cannot meaningfully approve.
