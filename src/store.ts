// 汀's state: the day, the pending proposals, and the thing you can still undo.

// ⚠️ No optimistic updates on writes. Every action re-reads, and that is the
// point rather than laziness: PATCH /api/plan can be REFUSED with 409 by the
// plan gate (a locked or petrified block), and a proposal can be answered by a
// second tab between the render and the tap. 汀's entire premise is that the
// screen answers "what now" truthfully — a screen showing a completed task the
// server still considers open is the one failure it cannot afford.
//
// The cost is a round trip per action, on a screen that shows one thing at a
// time. That is the cheap direction.
